PROJECT ITravelYNot:
ITravelYNot.com is a website that provides general travel information such as weather, nearby lodging, eating and entertainment options based of the the destination input by the user.

BUILD STATUS:
This is a project I plan on to keep updating with better features as my coding skills develop more and more. 
At the moment the site is fully function with all the basic features such as providing the weather, name of nearby places and their addresses. Right now I am working on making the results also include pictures of the places provided as results. Pictures are already being displayed, just arent positioned in the right areas yet.
